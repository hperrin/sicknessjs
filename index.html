    <h1>Sickness.js</h1>
    <p>
      Sickness is a JavaScript library that aims to emulate what it's like after
      an entire day of coding, when you're coming down off your Red Bull high,
      and everything starts to look a little jittery.
    </p>
    <p>
      It's named Sickness because if you experience this feeling, you have a
      sickness, just like me. It's not a bad thing. It's a productive sickness.
      Workaholics, perfectionists, enthusiasts; good names for the same people.
      It makes your boss happy, but your partner might not feel the same. Maybe
      this page will remind you to take a break. You can always come back to it
      tomorrow.
    </p>
    <p>Good luck and happy coding.</p>
